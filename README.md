## An Adorable Attempt at Extortion

> "Be careful what you fish for."

- I received a strange e-mail a couple of months ago which motivated me to do a bit of detective work to see what I could find out about the source of the message.
- As I am now fairly confident that I have determined the source I felt that it would be amusing to publicize this information in the hope that the suspect shits himself if/when he sees this and realizes that he dun goofed.
- Admittedly I could be mistaken, and offer my apologies if that is so, but all signs seem to point to the conclusion I have found with high probability.
- All information has been forwarded to authorities as well as to a few acquaintances who enjoy this sort of thing and are eager to assist.
- Some information has been publicly omitted but is available in an encrypted file which is included at `/encrypted/MrXyfir.json`.
	- If you would like the decryption key then e-mail me with a short message explaining your intentions: mwtheta@protonmail.com

### Timeline of Events

- April 20 2022 I logged into GitHub and saw a notification that on April 18 someone had started following my account: <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a>
- A few days later after logging in again I noticed that MrXyfir had unfollowed me.
	- Had he followed me by mistake?
	- Had he seen something which he did not like?
		- Perhaps my <a href="https://github.com/xnhl/riots" target="_blank">riots</a> project?
			- My personal archives of repository info (with views, clones, et cetera) reveal that there was one view of my riots project on April 18 (the day MrXyfir began following me).
		- I imagine that <a href="https://cata-list.github.io" target="_blank">cata-list</a> has also earned me some enemies and could be a possibility.
	- Presumably, this is when he began plotting his genius 4D-chess strategy to extort me.
- I thought nothing more of this until 19 days later on May 7 when I received the <a href="#message-received">strange e-mail</a> from a truly dizzying intellect.
	- The first thing which struck me about the e-mail was the sender/return address: mwtheta@mwtheta.net
		- Address does not exist which reveals that the skillset of the sender includes spoofing addresses and anonymously sending e-mail.
- Recalling the recent and strange follow/unfollow of <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a> I checked out his GitHub page and found that one of his pinned repositories is <a href="https://github.com/xyfir/ptorx" target="_blank">ptorx</a> from another GitHub account which he also presumably owns: <a href="https://github.com/xyfir" target="_blank">xyfir</a>
	- <a href="https://github.com/xyfir/ptorx" target="_blank">ptorx</a> enables users to: "Send and receive mail without using your real email address", "Anonymously forward and send mail with email forwarding and aliases".
		- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YmMNpbFjp0" target="_blank">thatwaseasy.mp3</a>
- No other e-mail was received at Protonmail address for months before/after this message.
	- Another reason to believe that these events are connected.
- MrXyfir seems to be the only reasonable suspect at this time.


### Personal Details of Suspect

- <a href="#message-received">Writing sample.</a>
- Location (via GitHub): California, United States.
- Occupation: Developer? Repositories indicate experience with React.
- Adorable bluffing skills of a small child.
- Able and willing to send spoofed / anonymous e-mail.
- npm-download-faker repository reveals willingness to create fake information for personal gain.
- Willingness to extort strangers.
	- Presumably based on differing political views, in this case.
- Username (Mr. Cypher) and plain black GitHub avatar suggest desire to conceal personal information.
	- Reasonable in the time / society we live in, but suggestive in light of other details like attempted extortion.
- Moderate understanding of English, but it seems likely that it is his second language which suggests that he is not white.
	- Surname of known associate is Matsumoto (Japanese). Perhaps MrXyfir/xyfir is Japanese as well.
- Somewhat versed in cryptocurrency usage.
	- Bitcoin wallet (for tracking past/future use): bc1q033cjppaea0c2xvw6mwz7c3uf2f3dt9y9ssrx6

- Reddit account: https://www.reddit.com/user/MrXyfir
- Twitter account: https://twitter.com/MrXyfir
- Fandom account (Kingkiller Series): https://kingkiller.fandom.com/wiki/User:MrXyfir
	- Motivation to become involed with the community for a series of novels suggests that it made a strong positive impact on him.
		- This suggests support for / identification with <a href="https://kingkiller.fandom.com/wiki/Kvothe" target="_blank">Kvothe</a> (the hero and protagonist), though, ironically, extortion would seem to suggest MrXyfir is more of an <a href="https://kingkiller.fandom.com/wiki/Ambrose_Jakis" target="_blank">Ambrose</a> (the antagonist, bully).
		- I have also read and enjoyed the series (not for the purposes of this document) and so understand the characters.
- Association with Koichi Matsumoto
	- Only other contributor to <a href="https://github.com/xyfir/ptorx" target="_blank">ptorx</a> beside <a href="https://github.com/xyfir" target="_blank">xyfir</a>

	- Possible LinkedIn account: <a href="https://jp.linkedin.com/in/koichimatsumotoprofile" target="_blank">Here</a>
		- Details match expectations: Frontend Developer in Tokyo, Japan.
	- If he is not MrXyfir/xyfir then he probably knows who is.
- Strong focus on sexual strategy for extortion
	- Could just be the easy and common route.
	- Could suggest that his accusations are confession through projection and he has got some weird shit going on in that cavernous cranium.
- Unique, noteworthy, identifying words/phrases/et cetera
	- (o_0)!
	- "Owh"
		- Alternate / misspelling of "Oh"?
		- Could possibly be common and reveal info about culture / location.
	- "Everything ingenious is quite simple"
	- "I purchased from hackers the access to multiple email accounts"
		- Admission of guilt / breaking the law.
	- "I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours"
		- Admission of guilt / breaking the law.
	- "Virus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based)"
		- Admission that he uses/designs viruses.
	- "my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer"
		- Admission of guilt / breaking the law.

	- "Do not try searching for me  there is absolutely no reason to do that"
		- LOL. Just very amusing.

Hi. How are you?

I know, its unpleasant to start the conversation with bad news, but I have no choice.
Few months ago, I have gained access to your devices that used by you for internet browsing.
Afterwards, I could track down all your internet activities.

Here is the history of how it could become possible:
At first, I purchased from hackers the access to multiple email accounts (nowadays, it is a really simple thing to do online).
As result, I could easily log in to your email account (-).

One week later, I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours, which you use to open email.
Frankly speaking, it was rather straightforward (since you were opening the links from your inbox emails).
Everything ingenious is quite simple. (o_0)!

My software enables me with access to all controllers inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.
I could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.
I can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.
Virus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.

Hence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.

As I was gathering information about you, I couldnt help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.
You actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.
I could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.

If you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions,
it only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues.
I can also make those vids become accessible by public.
I honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch,
(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.

However, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:
Everything you are required to do is a single transfer of $1370 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer),
and once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.
After that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well.
Make no doubt that I will fulfill my part.

This is really a great deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.
If you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process  it can be straightforwardly done by getting all the necessary information online.

Here is my bitcoin wallet provided below: bc1q033cjppaea0c2xvw6mwz7c3uf2f3dt9y9ssrx6

You should complete the abovementioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.

The following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:
#Do not try replying my email (email in your inbox was generated by me alongside with return email address).
#Do not try calling police as well as other security forces. In addition, abstain from sharing this story with your friends.
After I find out (be sure, I can easily do that, given that I keep complete control of all your devices)  your kinky video will end up being available to public right away.
#Do not try searching for me  there is absolutely no reason to do that. Moreover, all transactions in cryptocurrency are always anonymous.
#Do not try reinstalling the OS on your devices or throwing them away. It is pointless as well, since all your videos have already been uploaded to remote servers.

The following list contains things you should not be worried about:
#That your money wont reach my account.
 Rest assured, the transactions can be tracked, hence once the transaction is complete,
I will know about it, because I continuously observe all your activities (my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer).
#That I still will share your kinky videos to public after you complete money transfer.
 Trust me, its pointless for me to continue troubling your life. If I really wanted, I would make it happen already!

Lets make this deal in a fair manner!

Owh, one more thingin future it is best that you dont involve yourself in similar situations any longer!
One last advice from me  recurrently change all your passwords from all accounts.
