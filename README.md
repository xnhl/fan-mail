# Fan Mail

## Amusing selections from my hate/spam mail.

---

## An Adorable Attempt at Extortion

> "Be careful what you fish for."

- I received an e-mail a couple of months ago which motivated me to do a bit of detective work to see what I could find out about the source of the message.
- As I am now fairly confident that I have determined the source I felt that it would be amusing to publicize this information in the hope that the suspect shits himself if/when he sees this and realizes that he dun goofed.
- Admittedly I could be mistaken, and offer my apologies if that is so, but all signs seem to point to the conclusion I have found with high probability.
- All information has been forwarded to authorities as well as to a few acquaintances who enjoy this sort of thing and are eager to assist.
- Some information has been publicly omitted but selections are available in encrypted files included in the /encrypted directory.
	- If you would like the decryption key then e-mail me with a short message explaining your intentions: mwtheta@protonmail.com
- I realize that this is a lot of information to take in and that its organization is not ideal, but I'm doing what I can.

<ul>
	<li>Presumably, this is when he began plotting his genius 4D-chess strategy to extort me.</li>
	<li>Had he followed me by mistake?</li>

			<li>Perhaps my <a href="https://github.com/xnhl/riots" target="_blank">riots</a> project?

					<li>My personal archives of repository info (with views, clones, et cetera) reveal that there was one view of my riots project on April 18 (the day <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a> began following me).</li>
					<li>MrXyfir may have personal connections in Portland.

<li>I thought nothing more of this until 19 days later on May 7 when I received the e-mail from a truly dizzying intellect.
	<ul>
		<li>The first thing which struck me about the e-mail was the sender/return address: mwtheta@mwtheta.net
			<ul>
				<li>Address does not exist which reveals that the skillset of the sender includes spoofing addresses and anonymously sending e-mail.</li>
				<li>Address is a variation on my main Protonmail address which could indicate that I was targeted personally rather than being just an address in a list.</li>

<li>Recalling the recent and strange follow/unfollow of <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a> I checked out his GitHub page and found that one of his pinned repositories is <a href="https://github.com/xyfir/ptorx" target="_blank">ptorx</a> which is owned by <a href="https://github.com/xyfir" target="_blank">xyfir</a> (which he also presumably operates).

<ul>
	<li><b>Probable confirmation</b></li>
	<li>Shortly after I began making a list of users who <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a> follows on GitHub I realized that the number was increasing at a rate of several per minute.
	<ul>
		<li>It was ~100 when I first noticed, ~400 when I checked back a couple of hours later, ~1,200 when I checked back again a few hours later.
		<ul>
			<li>~2,900 in screenshot from days ago.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>This change indicates:
		<ul>
			<li>Awareness of observation.</li>
			<li>Desire / attempt to obfuscate this information.
			<ul>
				<li>What is he trying to hide?</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>He created a way to programatically remove all people he is following and then add them all again (repeating?).</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>I have received no new messages.
	<ul>
		<li>If he were entirely innocent and my allegations were absurd:
		<ul>
			<li>Expected reaction: Some kind of message: "I understand your motivation but you're way off."</li>
			<li>Actual reaction:
			<ul>
				<li>Noticed he is being observed.</li>
				<li>Created process to remove his GitHub "following" list and then add them again (possibly repeating the process).</li>
				<li>Possibly/probably cloned a bunch of my projects.

	</li>
	<li>Awareness of observation + information obfuscation + no new messages

		<li>Seems to offer further confirmation that I'm correct.

			<li>However, continued action suggests that, rather than acknowledging defeat, he would prefer to see just how deep he can dig that grave.

		<li>Fake follower count
			<ul>
				<li>For a few months he was running a script/process which manipulates list of accounts which he follows. He may be using a tool like <a href="https://github.com/imraazrally/GreedyGit" target="_blank">GreedyGit</a>.</li>
				<li>About every 15 seconds a new user is added and when the count reaches ~4,000 then list is reset to 0 and process repeats with new users.</li>
				<li>List resets around 4,000 users to avoid notice by GitHub so they don't ban his account for clear abuse.</li>
				<li>Users he follows mistakenly imagine that there is a reason he is following them and so they follow him back.</li>
				<li>His followers list is therefore made up of unthinking dummies who simply "follow for follow".</li>
				<li>With his ability to create bots and spoof e-mail addresses it's possible that he has created fake accounts to further inflate the list of users which follow him.</li>
				<li>For verification I made screenshots (.jpg, .pdf) of all pages of Following list for 5 consecutive days.</li>
				<li>I also made lists (.json) of all users in Following list for many days to attempt to find patterns, and I used the GitHub API to get info for all accounts in the list.</li>
				<li>See <a href="https://github.com/xnhl/fan-mail-assets" target="_blank">fan-mail-assets</a> repository for screenshots and user lists.</li>
				<li>After I made a large collection of users which were in his Following list I decided to stop keeping track at ~200,000.</li>
				<li>Additional data for ~200,000 accounts (account info, repositories, following list, followers list) would take days to merge and the zipped collections would be too large to host on GitHub so it has been omitted.</li>
				<li>His process has since been paused and the Following count remains ~2,300 as of October 26, 2022.</li>

			<summary><p style="display: inline">Possible connection with many fake Twitter accounts (probably bots) which have been following me on <a href="https://twitter.com/cata_lyze" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p></summary>
			<ul>
				<li>Pattern:
					<ul>
						<li>Young and attractive Asian women whose tweets and images (with faces often obscured) often indicate interest in: cryptocurrencies, golf, yoga/exercise, travel, luxury items, nonsense quotations.</li>
						<li>The lists of accounts they follow are often/always in the hundreds and filled with cryptocurrency enthusiasts.</li>
						<li>Seems like they are pretty obvious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment_of_spies#Love,_honeypots,_and_recruitment" target="_blank">honeypots</a> intended to find lonely and/or rich men to blackmail and/or steal from.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Interesting note:
					<ul>
						<li>Since the previous update on October 26 in which I added the list below I have received 2 messages (which are the only messages I've received on Twitter) from more obviously fake accounts which conform to the pattern.</li>
						<li>The first message (from <a href="https://twitter.com/fhuy85838910" target="_blank">fhuy85838910</a>) was received on October 30 (just 4 days after this document was updated)</li>
						<li>The second message (from <a href="https://twitter.com/MK88588" target="_blank">MK88588</a>) was received on November 4 (just 9 days after this document was updated).</li>
						<li>The fact that the messages came so soon after updating this repository strongly suggests a connection with the peerless intellects who have been targeting me and watching my accounts and repositories.</li>
						<li>Really subtle, guys. You are clearly sending your best, and I am shaking in my boots. Keep up your brilliant strategies which must have been taken straight from The Art of War.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Additional information:
					<ul>
						<li>I have scraped all tweets (for the accounts which are still active) and then downloaded all of the images which they have uploaded.</li>
						<li>Tweets and images can be found in /twitter_fakes directory.</li>
					</ul>

<li>Username (Mr. Cipher) and plain black GitHub avatar suggest desire to conceal personal information.

<summary>Language: Moderate understanding of English (judging by received e-mail), but it seems likely that it is his second language which may suggest that he is not white.</summary>
<ul>
	<li>If working as team (as ptorx contributors list suggests) then perhaps Koichi Matsumoto wrote the message while Christopher Fietz is doing other work.</li>
	<li>Surname of known associate is Matsumoto (Japanese). Perhaps <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a>/<a href="https://github.com/xyfir" target="_blank">xyfir</a> is Japanese as well.</li>
	<li>Evidence that he is familiar with Chinese.
	<ul>
		<li>Made changes to a repository (<a href="https://github.com/swiftdemand/protocol/pull/11" target="_blank">swiftdemand/protocol</a>) and his comment on changes: "I've added English comments for a small part of certain sections of the codebase. Many Chinese comments that once translated to English were redundant and so removed completely. I make no guarantees about the accuracy of the comments. I think it's better than it was before but that's probably up for debate. Merge if you wish."</li>

				<li>History as Reddit moderator likely indicates authoritarian inclination which fits with probable Leftist ideology.</li>

Hi. How are you?

I know, its unpleasant to start the conversation with bad news, but I have no choice.
Few months ago, I have gained access to your devices that used by you for internet browsing.
Afterwards, I could track down all your internet activities.

Here is the history of how it could become possible:
At first, I purchased from hackers the access to multiple email accounts (nowadays, it is a really simple thing to do online).
As result, I could easily log in to your email account (-).

One week later, I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours, which you use to open email.
Frankly speaking, it was rather straightforward (since you were opening the links from your inbox emails).
Everything ingenious is quite simple. (o_0)!

My software enables me with access to all controllers inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.
I could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.
I can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.
Virus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.

Hence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.

As I was gathering information about you, I couldnt help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.
You actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.
I could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.

If you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions,
it only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues.
I can also make those vids become accessible by public.
I honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch,
(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.

However, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:
Everything you are required to do is a single transfer of $1370 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer),
and once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.
After that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well.
Make no doubt that I will fulfill my part.

This is really a great deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.
If you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process  it can be straightforwardly done by getting all the necessary information online.

Here is my bitcoin wallet provided below: bc1q033cjppaea0c2xvw6mwz7c3uf2f3dt9y9ssrx6

You should complete the abovementioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.

The following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:
#Do not try replying my email (email in your inbox was generated by me alongside with return email address).
#Do not try calling police as well as other security forces. In addition, abstain from sharing this story with your friends.
After I find out (be sure, I can easily do that, given that I keep complete control of all your devices)  your kinky video will end up being available to public right away.
#Do not try searching for me  there is absolutely no reason to do that. Moreover, all transactions in cryptocurrency are always anonymous.
#Do not try reinstalling the OS on your devices or throwing them away. It is pointless as well, since all your videos have already been uploaded to remote servers.

The following list contains things you should not be worried about:
#That your money wont reach my account.
 Rest assured, the transactions can be tracked, hence once the transaction is complete,
I will know about it, because I continuously observe all your activities (my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer).
#That I still will share your kinky videos to public after you complete money transfer.
 Trust me, its pointless for me to continue troubling your life. If I really wanted, I would make it happen already!

Lets make this deal in a fair manner!

Owh, one more thingin future it is best that you dont involve yourself in similar situations any longer!
One last advice from me  recurrently change all your passwords from all accounts.
