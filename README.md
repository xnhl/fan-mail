## An Adorable Attempt at Extortion

> "Be careful what you fish for."

- I received a strange e-mail a couple of months ago which motivated me to do a bit of detective work to see what I could find out about the source of the message.
- As I am now fairly confident that I have determined the source I felt that it would be amusing to publicize this information in the hope that the suspect shits himself if/when he sees this and realizes that he dun goofed.
- Admittedly I could be mistaken, and offer my apologies if that is so, but all signs seem to point to the conclusion I have found with high probability.
- All information has been forwarded to authorities as well as to a few acquaintances who enjoy this sort of thing and are eager to assist.
- Some information has been publicly omitted but is available in an encrypted file which is included at `/encrypted/MrXyfir.json`.
	- If you would like the decryption key then e-mail me with a short message explaining your intentions: mwtheta@protonmail.com

### Timeline of Events

- April 20 2022 I logged into GitHub and saw a notification that on April 18 <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a> had started following my account.
- A few days later after logging in again I noticed that <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a> had unfollowed me.
	- Had he followed me by mistake?
	- Had he seen something which he did not like?
		- Perhaps my <a href="https://github.com/xnhl/riots" target="_blank">riots</a> project?
			- My personal archives of repository info (with views, clones, et cetera) reveal that there was one view of my riots project on April 18 (the day <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a> began following me).
		- I imagine that <a href="https://cata-list.github.io" target="_blank">cata-list</a> has also earned me some enemies and could be a possibility.
		- My public support of the Canadian truckers' Freedom Convoy & protests (2022) on Twitter account for cata-list
	- Presumably, this is when he began plotting his genius 4D-chess strategy to extort me.
- I thought nothing more of this until 19 days later on May 7 when I received the <a href="#message-received">strange e-mail</a> from a truly dizzying intellect.
	- The first thing which struck me about the e-mail was the sender/return address: mwtheta@mwtheta.net
		- Address does not exist which reveals that the skillset of the sender includes spoofing addresses and anonymously sending e-mail.
- Recalling the recent and strange follow/unfollow of <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a> I checked out his GitHub page and found that one of his pinned repositories is <a href="https://github.com/xyfir/ptorx" target="_blank">ptorx</a> which is owned by <a href="https://github.com/xyfir" target="_blank">xyfir</a> (which he also presumably operates).
	- <a href="https://github.com/xyfir/ptorx" target="_blank">ptorx</a> enables users to: "Send and receive mail without using your real email address", "Anonymously forward and send mail with email forwarding and aliases".
		- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YmMNpbFjp0" target="_blank">thatwaseasy.mp3</a>
- No other e-mail was received at Protonmail address for months before/after this message.
	- Another reason to believe that these events are connected.
- <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a> seems to be the only reasonable suspect at this time.
- Further developments will follow.


### Personal Details of Suspect

- Possible identities:
	- **Christopher Fietz**
	- Koichi Matsumoto
	- Group/team rather than individual?
- Location
	- GitHub page and Twitter say California, United States.
		- https://github.com/MrXyfir
		- https://twitter.com/MrXyfir
	- Possible LinkedIn profile says Calgary, Alberta, Canada
		- https://ca.linkedin.com/in/cwfietz
		- Could be dual citizen. 
	- Japan a possibility (specifically Tokyo)?
		- See connection with <a href="https://github.com/mzch" target="_blank">Koichi Matsumoto</a>
- Occupation:
	- Developer? GitHub repositories indicate experience with React.
	- LinkedIn for Christopher Fietz indicates experience with React.
		- See screenshot or link: https://ca.linkedin.com/in/cwfietz
		- Also says he works as a "Full Stack Software Developer"
		- Therefore: GitHub and LinkedIn info match and strongly suggest connection.
- <a href="#message-received">Writing sample.</a>
- Adorable bluffing skills of a small child.
- Possibly a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=furry" target="_blank">furry</a> (see details and screenshots below).
- Able and willing to send spoofed / anonymous e-mail.
- <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir/npm-download-faker" target="_blank">npm-download-faker</a> repository reveals willingness to create fake information for personal gain.
- Willingness to extort strangers.
	- Presumably based on differing political views, in this case.
- Being able to spoof e-mail + creating fake information for personal gain + being willing to extort others suggest method of retaliation:
	- He may attempt to create fake information about me and make it public (especially if all else fails).
- Username (Mr. Cypher) and plain black GitHub avatar suggest desire to conceal personal information.
	- Reasonable in the time / society we live in, but suggestive in light of other details like attempted extortion.
- Moderate understanding of English, but it seems likely that it is his second language which suggests that he is not white.
	- If working as team (as ptorx contributors list suggests) then perhaps Koichi Matsumoto wrote the message while Christopher Fietz is doing other work.
	- Surname of known associate is Matsumoto (Japanese). Perhaps <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a>/<a href="https://github.com/xyfir" target="_blank">xyfir</a> is Japanese as well.
- Somewhat versed in cryptocurrency usage (at least Bitcoin).
	- Bitcoin wallet (for tracking past/future use): bc1q033cjppaea0c2xvw6mwz7c3uf2f3dt9y9ssrx6
	- Made at least ~$3,472 in trades (Bitcoin for Amazon / other gift card balances) with other users on Reddit (see below)
	- Bitcoin drastic value loss = potential motivation for initial message to me?
		- Over roughly past 6 months Bitcoin has lost about half of its value
		- A drastic loss started April 18 2022 after a significant loss of about $3,000 just weeks before that.
			- Same day as initial message to me
			- See plateau on chart on April 17 2022 before drop
			- See screenshot of bitcoinity website chart
			- ~$41,000 before recent decline, now ~$20,700
			- Link: https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/price_volume/6m/USD?t=lb&vu=curr

					- <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a>/<a href="https://github.com/xyfir" target="_blank">xyfir</a> kindly requests "$1370 USD" to be sent to "my bitcoin wallet provided below: bc1q033cjppaea0c2xvw6mwz7c3uf2f3dt9y9ssrx6"

	- (Kingkiller Series): https://kingkiller.fandom.com/wiki/User:MrXyfir
		- Motivation to become involved with the community for a series of novels suggests that it made a strong positive impact on him.
			- This suggests support for / identification with <a href="https://kingkiller.fandom.com/wiki/Kvothe" target="_blank">Kvothe</a> (the hero and protagonist), though, ironically, extortion would seem to suggest <a href="https://github.com/MrXyfir" target="_blank">MrXyfir</a> is more of an <a href="https://kingkiller.fandom.com/wiki/Ambrose_Jakis" target="_blank">Ambrose</a> (an antagonist & bully).

Don’t forget to pay the tax within 2 days!

From: mwtheta@mwtheta.net <mwtheta@mwtheta.net>

To: mwtheta@protonmail.com

Date: Saturday, May 7th, 2022 at 12:14 AM

Hi. How are you?

I know, its unpleasant to start the conversation with bad news, but I have no choice.
Few months ago, I have gained access to your devices that used by you for internet browsing.
Afterwards, I could track down all your internet activities.

Here is the history of how it could become possible:
At first, I purchased from hackers the access to multiple email accounts (nowadays, it is a really simple thing to do online).
As result, I could easily log in to your email account (-).

One week later, I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours, which you use to open email.
Frankly speaking, it was rather straightforward (since you were opening the links from your inbox emails).
Everything ingenious is quite simple. (o_0)!

My software enables me with access to all controllers inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.
I could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.
I can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.
Virus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.

Hence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.

As I was gathering information about you, I couldnt help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.
You actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.
I could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.

If you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions,
it only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues.
I can also make those vids become accessible by public.
I honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch,
(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.

However, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:
Everything you are required to do is a single transfer of $1370 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer),
and once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.
After that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well.
Make no doubt that I will fulfill my part.

This is really a great deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.
If you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process  it can be straightforwardly done by getting all the necessary information online.

Here is my bitcoin wallet provided below: bc1q033cjppaea0c2xvw6mwz7c3uf2f3dt9y9ssrx6

You should complete the abovementioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.

The following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:
#Do not try replying my email (email in your inbox was generated by me alongside with return email address).
#Do not try calling police as well as other security forces. In addition, abstain from sharing this story with your friends.
After I find out (be sure, I can easily do that, given that I keep complete control of all your devices)  your kinky video will end up being available to public right away.
#Do not try searching for me  there is absolutely no reason to do that. Moreover, all transactions in cryptocurrency are always anonymous.
#Do not try reinstalling the OS on your devices or throwing them away. It is pointless as well, since all your videos have already been uploaded to remote servers.

The following list contains things you should not be worried about:
#That your money wont reach my account.
 Rest assured, the transactions can be tracked, hence once the transaction is complete,
I will know about it, because I continuously observe all your activities (my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer).
#That I still will share your kinky videos to public after you complete money transfer.
 Trust me, its pointless for me to continue troubling your life. If I really wanted, I would make it happen already!

Lets make this deal in a fair manner!

Owh, one more thingin future it is best that you dont involve yourself in similar situations any longer!
One last advice from me  recurrently change all your passwords from all accounts.
```
